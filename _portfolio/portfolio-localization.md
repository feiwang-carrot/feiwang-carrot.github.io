This is the matlab code for the paper "[Noisy Euclidean distance matrix completion with a single missing node](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10898-019-00825-7)"

We present several solution techniques for the noisy single source localization problem, i.e. the Euclidean distance matrix completion problem with a single missing node to locate under noisy data.
We present several approaches to solve this problem efficiently, and we compare their performance with existing techniques in the literature.
