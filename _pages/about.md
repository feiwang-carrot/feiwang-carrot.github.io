Welcome to my home on the web!
======
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Fields Institute and University of Waterloo working in the field of optimization and combinatorial rigidity. From January 2021 to July 2021, I am a participant in the fields Thematic program on the Geometric Constraint Systems, Framework Rigidity, and Distance Geometry. 
From September 2017 to August 2019, I am a postdoctoral researcher at Department of Mathematics, KTH, Sweden. Prior to that, I completed my PhD study in Applied Mathematics at Western University.

My research interests are: 
------

1. Theory and algorithms in convex optimization:  linear programming (LP), quadratic programming (QP), semidefinite programming (SDP), and other related convex optimization problems.  

2. Integer programming (IP), mixed integer programming problems(MIP). Application of continuous conic relaxations in solving combinatorial optimization problems.

3. Distance geometry, Matrix completion and rigidity theory and their connections with optimization.
