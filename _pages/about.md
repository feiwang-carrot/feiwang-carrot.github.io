Welcome to my home on the web!
======
I am currently working at PoissonSoft as an Algorithm Enginneer in the constraint solver team, my major role is to develop and optimize the nonlinear solver used in the geometric constraint solver. Previously I was a researcher at Fields Institute and University of Waterloo working in the field of optimization and combinatorial rigidity.
From September 2017 to August 2019, I am a postdoctoral researcher at Department of Mathematics, KTH, Sweden. Prior to that, I completed my PhD study in Applied Mathematics at Western University.



My Areas of Expertise are: 
------

1. Deep understanding of linear and nonlinear optimization theory and algorithms. 

2. Solid Skills in C++ programming with successful implementation and application of advanced optimization algorithms to solve complex industrial challenges. 

3. Specialized knowledge in sparse matrix factorization techniques, and ability to write efficient code for sparse matrix factorization.
