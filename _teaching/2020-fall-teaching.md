Course Description: This is a course on linear algebra and its applications to engineering. Topics to be
covered include complex numbers; vectors, lines and planes; systems of linear equations; matrices, linear
transformations and determinants; introduction to vector spaces; eigenvalues, eigenvectors and diagonaliza-
tion; and additional topics as time permits. We approach the material through a blend of theoretical ideas,
computational methods and some applications.

Intended Learning Outcomes:
• Solve problems using complex numbers and describe how they differ from real numbers
• Solve geometrical problems using vectors, lines, and planes
• Explain the concepts of linear independence, spanning, subspaces, and bases
• Solve systems of linear equations using matrices and inverse matrices
• Recognize the link between matrices and linear mappings, and work with certain linear mappings
including projections, reflections, and rotations
• Locate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix and diagonalize a matrix
• Understand the basic concepts of abstract vector spaces
