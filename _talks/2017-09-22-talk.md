[SYNASC 2017](https://synasc.ro/2017/program/) 19th International Symposium on Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing.

Given a polynomial system over real coefficients and an arbitrary polynomial to test, We present an SDP-based method to verify if the input polynomial belongs to the
real radical ideal of the given polynomial system. Our method utilizes tools from semidefinite programming, moment matrix and real algebraic geometry.
