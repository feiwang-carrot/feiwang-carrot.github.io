Graduate Course on Real algebraic & Distance geometry in Discrete Structures and Kinematics

This course, led by Meera Sitharam, will feature a number of lecturers and cover kinematics and those aspects of real algebraic geometry relevant to geometric constraint systems. The course should be accessible to any graduate student in mathematics and the only background assumed will be in basic linear algebra, Euclidean geometry and commutative algebra.

Geometric constraint systems are polynomial systems that underlie discrete structures arising in diverse pure and applied mathematical areas  including algorithmic foundations.  They are also widely employed in modeling and design in the sciences and engineering, from kinematics, robotics, molecular and materials modeling, computer aided mechanical design,  and virtual reality.
 
This course concerns the principles of geometric constraint systems,  and will touch briefly upon applications.
The course will use both mathematical  and algorithmic foundational perspectives for analyzing geometric constraint systems and their solutions;  and  for solving them.
