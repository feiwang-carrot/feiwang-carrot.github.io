[ICCOPT 2019](https://iccopt2019.berlin/) the 6th International Coneference on Continuous Optimization.

We present several solution techniques for the noisy single source localization problem, i.e. the Euclidean distance matrix completion problem with a single missing node to locate under noisy data. For the case that the sensor locations are fixed, we show that this problem is implicitly convex, and we provide a purification algorithm along with the SDP relaxation to solve it efficiently and accurately. For the case that the sensor locations are relaxed, we study a model based on facial reduction. We present several approaches to solve this problem efficiently, and we compare their performance with existing techniques in the literature.
